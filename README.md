# Motivation
Our project focuses on predicting future stock changes using the attitude of social media posts (specifically Twitter). During the 20th century, the main investment theory was the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). This theory states that the market reflects all the available information and that investors act rationally. However, the financial crises and the bubbles have demonstrated that sentiments and irrationality play a significant role in financial decision making. The Nobel Prize Robert Shiller challenged the EMH in an article in 1982 by comparing the US economy performances and the stock market during the 1920s. Several other distinguished economists have proved the presence of behavioral biases in stock market fluctuations. The Behavioral Finance Theory attempts to explain these irrational components.

## Challenging the Efficient Market Hypothesis





## Our thesis
The movement of the market can be predicted by augmenting rational economic data, standard micro and macroeconomic predictive indexes, with a model quantifying irrational behavior, a sentiment analysis of social media.
